    <description>[h1]WARNING! Do not use this mod if you are trying to get your Mega Satan or Beast unlocks! The unlocks/achievements/completion marks are tied to the cutscenes.[/h1]

This mod was inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2667845009]NO Mega Satan auto cutscene[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938928749]AlwaysVoid[/url]. It can block the cutscenes from automatically playing after Mega Satan and The Beast.

[list]
    [*]Mega Satan
    [list]
        [*]A chest will spawn in the boss room
        [*]Optionally, a fool card will spawn
        [*]Optionally, a void portal will also spawn
    [/list]
    [*]The Beast
    [list]
        [*]You'll be taken back to the living room where you fought Dogma
        [*]A chest will spawn
        [*]Optionally, a void portal will also spawn
    [/list]
[/list]

For challenges, trophies will spawn instead of chests.

Mod Config Menu can be used to:
[list]
    [*]block the cutscenes after Mega Satan and/or The Beast
    [*]change the void portal spawning probability
    [*]spawn 0 - The Fool after Mega Satan (lets you teleport back to the main map)
    [*]apply your settings to challenges or not
[/list]

Note: Even if you choose to allow the Mega Satan cutscene, the game may still decide to spawn a chest and void portal instead.

Note: Walking into the chest after The Beast will end the game, but it won't increment your win streak. You'll need to go fight Delirium if you want a +1.</description>
