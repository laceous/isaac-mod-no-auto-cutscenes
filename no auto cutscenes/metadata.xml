    <description>[h1]WARNING! Do not use this mod if you are trying to get your Mega Satan or Beast unlocks! The unlocks/achievements/completion marks are tied to the cutscenes.[/h1]

This mod was inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2667845009]NO Mega Satan auto cutscene[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938928749]AlwaysVoid[/url]. It can block the cutscenes from automatically playing after Mega Satan and The Beast.

[list]
    [*]Mega Satan
    [list]
        [*]A chest will spawn in the boss room
        [*]Optionally, a void portal will also spawn
    [/list]
    [*]The Beast
    [list]
        [*]You'll be taken back to the living room where you fought Dogma
        [*]A chest will spawn
        [*]Optionally, a void portal will also spawn
    [/list]
[/list]

For challenges, trophies will spawn instead of chests.

Mod Config Menu can be used to selectively block the cutscenes after Mega Satan and/or The Beast. You can change the void portal spawning probability. And you can choose to apply your settings to challenges or not.

Note: Even if you choose to allow the Mega Satan cutscene, the game may still decide to spawn a chest and void portal instead.</description>
